# scrappy_plotter
RPi based plotter

These are the sources for the driver of the plotter as well as the files that transform images to lines and use the driver to plot the picture.

The main file is 'scrappy_plotter.py' which is used to get an image, transform it, and then plot it. 
Usage: >python scrappy_plotter.py ./images/ofer.png

Enjoy!
